# Expert Judgment Matrix: C3 Secondary Indicators
# AHP pairwise comparison for C3 Strike Capability indicators

matrix_id: "c3_secondary_indicators"
expert_id: "expert_001"
primary_capability: "C3"
comparison_scope: "C3_1, C3_2, C3_3 - Strike Capability indicators"
dimension: 3

# Comparison matrix (3×3 for C3 secondary indicators)
# Rows/Columns: C3_1, C3_2, C3_3
# Expert rationale: Maneuver positioning (C3_2) > Fire strike (C3_1) > Electronic warfare (C3_3) for modern naval combat
matrix:
  - [1.0, 0.666667, 1.5]    # C3_1 vs all (火力打击能力 vs others) - Important but position-dependent
  - [1.5, 1.0, 2.0]         # C3_2 vs all (机动占位能力 vs others) - Most critical for strike effectiveness and survival
  - [0.666667, 0.5, 1.0]     # C3_3 vs all (电子对抗能力 vs others) - Critical enabler but supporting role
