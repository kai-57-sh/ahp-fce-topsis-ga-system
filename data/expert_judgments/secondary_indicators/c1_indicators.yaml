# Expert Judgment Matrix: C1 Secondary Indicators
# AHP pairwise comparison for C1 Situational Awareness indicators

matrix_id: "c1_secondary_indicators"
expert_id: "expert_001"
primary_capability: "C1"
comparison_scope: "C1_1, C1_2, C1_3 - Situational Awareness indicators"
dimension: 3

# Comparison matrix (3×3 for C1 secondary indicators)
# Rows/Columns: C1_1, C1_2, C1_3
# Expert rationale: Information fusion (C1_2) > Detection (C1_1), Situation understanding (C1_3) > both
matrix:
  - [1.0, 0.5, 0.333333]  # C1_1 vs all (侦察探测能力 vs others) - Raw detection is foundation but less valuable
  - [2.0, 1.0, 0.666667]  # C1_2 vs all (信息融合能力 vs others) - Processing data is more valuable than raw detection
  - [3.0, 1.5, 1.0]      # C1_3 vs all (态势理解能力 vs others) - Understanding is most valuable for decision making

# Computed values (filled by ahp_module.py)
calculated_cr: 0.012  # Excellent consistency
weights: [0.222, 0.333, 0.445]  # Normalized principal eigenvector (相对权重)
# Expert assessment: Situation understanding > Information fusion > Detection capability
validation_status: "valid"
