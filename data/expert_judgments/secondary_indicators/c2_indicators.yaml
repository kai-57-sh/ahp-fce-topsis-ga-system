# AHP pairwise comparison for C2 Command Capability indicators

matrix_id: "c2_secondary_indicators"
expert_id: "expert_001"
primary_capability: "C2"
comparison_scope: "C2_1, C2_2, C2_3 - Command Capability indicators"
dimension: 3

# Comparison matrix (3×3 for C2 secondary indicators)
# Rows/Columns: C2_1, C2_2, C2_3
# Expert rationale: Decision response (C2_3) > Threat assessment (C2_2) > Mission planning (C2_1) for modern warfare
matrix:
  - [1.0, 0.8, 0.5]    # C2_1 vs all (任务规划能力 vs others) - Strategic planning but less time-critical
  - [1.25, 1.0, 0.625] # C2_2 vs all (威胁评估能力 vs others) - Tactical assessment important for effectiveness
  - [2.0, 1.6, 1.0]   # C2_3 vs all (决策响应能力 vs others) - OODA loop speed is most critical in modern warfare
