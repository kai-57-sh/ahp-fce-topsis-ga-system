# AHP pairwise comparison for C5 Survivability indicators

matrix_id: "c5_secondary_indicators"
expert_id: "expert_001"
primary_capability: "C5"
comparison_scope: "C5_1, C5_2, C5_3 - Survivability indicators"
dimension: 3

# Comparison matrix (3×3 for C5 secondary indicators)
# Rows/Columns: C5_1, C5_2, C5_3
# Expert rationale: Sustained operations (C5_3) > Anti-destruction (C5_1) > Mission recovery (C5_2) for modern campaigns
matrix:
  - [1.0, 1.5, 0.666667]   # C5_1 vs all (抗毁能力 vs others) - Important for survival but less critical than endurance
  - [0.666667, 1.0, 0.5]   # C5_2 vs all (任务恢复能力 vs others) - Backup capability, important but secondary
  - [1.5, 2.0, 1.0]        # C5_3 vs all (持续作战能力 vs others) - Most critical for sustained campaigns
