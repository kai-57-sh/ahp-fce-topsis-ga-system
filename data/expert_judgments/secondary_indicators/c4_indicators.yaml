matrix_id: "c4_secondary_indicators"
expert_id: "expert_001"
primary_capability: "C4"
comparison_scope: "C4_1, C4_2, C4_3 - Network Connectivity indicators"
dimension: 3

# Comparison matrix (3×3 for C4 secondary indicators)
# Rows/Columns: C4_1, C4_2, C4_3
# Expert rationale: Collaborative operations (C4_3) > Network reliability (C4_2) > Information transmission (C4_1)
matrix:
  - [1.0, 0.666667, 0.5]   # C4_1 vs all (信息传输能力 vs others) - Basic enabler but less valuable than outcomes
  - [1.5, 1.0, 0.666667]   # C4_2 vs all (网络可靠性 vs others) - Foundation for all network operations
  - [2.0, 1.5, 1.0]        # C4_3 vs all (协同作战能力 vs others) - Ultimate purpose of network-centric warfare
